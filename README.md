# MSD-E
This repository consists of code, results, and updates regarding our masked facial expression dataset -- MSD-E, and our paper 'Masked Student Dataset of Expressions'. Find code for experiments with [contrastive learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YkiJufBFZrHGgqL_22aO6AafQjFkECRR?usp=sharing), experiments with [knowledge distillation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gqBSpC22nMJQ2VSikst2OO0r_HzvEcBk?usp=sharing), and comparison with [SCAN](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UacZEOl9n9RTXQ5tGY_QdOGFv4wOfvEV?usp=sharing).

## Update on the dataset (Dec 2022):
Due to the evolving and sensitive nature of facial image datasets for computer vision, we have decided to puase any release of the dataset for the time being. Kindly email the author at solasridhar@gmail.com for any queries.
